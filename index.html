    <h1>Shakwan Williams</h1>
    <h2>Creative | Developer | Designer</h2>

    <p>At my foundation creativity runs wild. It doesn't limit itself to a single medium or title. I have an obession with learning, problem-solving, 
    and exploring concepts that influence everyday life. I can easily view an analytical dataset in the same way I do an art piece. The mission of having
    an "issue" to remedy takes many forms which has fortunately translated well into my Software Developement endeavors. I list my projects here with ongoing
    updates where available as well as my professional contact informatiton. Thankyou alot! I appreciate the opportunity to share with you! </p>
